## Javascript Sticky Scroll
Created for personal use but everyone is welcome to use this in any project.

### Usage
Add the class `.sticky` to any element and it should follow the user down by
setting `position: fixed` on the element.

### Known issues
1. "Stacking" two sticky elements is not supported, work-around by grouping
multiple elements in one `.sticky` container.

### Known limitations
1. No stop point is supported. Planned for implementation.
2. No configuration is supported. Planned for implementation.
